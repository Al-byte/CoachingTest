                  <p class="px-3 pt-3">Mark Washington is a young coach, trainer, journalist, broadcaster, teacher and mentor, son, brother, uncle and family man. He has worked diligently at building his impressive resume driven by his strong desire help others reach their maximum potential through the unifying nature of sports.

                    <br><br>Since childhood he's been extremely passionate about the world of sports and its greater impact on society. Sports run in his family, with multiple relatives having played youth, collegiate, and pro sports (cousin of NFL Hall Of Famer and Tampa Bay Bucs legend Warren Sapp). 
                    
                    <br><br>The "basketball bug" bit Mark at an early age, as he began training in the back yard with neighbor friends and relatives, which led to Junior Magic, then AAU with Team Sosa, and Middle School basketball at Apopka Memorial Middle School where he played for Coach Kreger and Coach Montgomery throughout his middle school career. Growing up in Apopka Florida in the 90s and 2000s some of his favorite players were Penny Hardaway, the late great Kobe Bryant, Allen Iverson, Tracy McGrady, Steph Curry, Kevin Garnett, and the GOAT Michael Jordan.
                    
                    <br><br>Upon entering high school Mark made the basketball team at Apopka High School during his freshman year. During his 4 years at AHS as a Blue Darter basketball player, he played under Coach Eddie Jenkins, Coach Matt Houvourous, Coach Brian Pitts and Coach Ed Coffee. Unfortunately, injuries began to mount as he sustained arm and knee surgeries during his freshmen, and senior seasons (fractured forearm and shattered knee cap).
                    
                    <br><br>After graduation Mark intended to attend FSU, but sustained yet another knee injury which redirected him from the Seminoles to the FAMU Rattlers instead. While at FAMU Mark majored in Broadcast Journalism and interned at ESPN Headquarters in Bristol, Connecticut. As the injuries took their toll on his body, ending his competitive playing days, he redirected his focus into the world of Sports Broadcasting. After graduating from FAMU, he attended graduate school and the University of South Florida (USF) where he majored in Mass Communications.
                    
                    <br><br>He has worked at ESPN, the ESPN Wide World of Sports, with the Orlando Magic, at Channel 9 Eyewitness News, with FM 102.5, FAMU-TV20, 90.5 WANM, the “FAMUan” newspaper, and the USF athletic department. He's been an anchor, a reporter, a radio host, an editor, a producer, writer, and more. 
                    
                    <br><br>The "on the court itch" never left him, and he returned to the court in 2015, but this time instead of a player, he was a coach. He's coached at Apopka High, Windermere Prep, Apopka Middle, Wolf Lake Middle, and Teague Middle. In his 5 years as a head basketball coach he's taken 4 teams to championship games, he's won 2 titles, 1 district title and is just getting started!
                    
                    <br><br>He has an affable personality, and a knack for connecting with the public, audiences, and athletes of all levels… This ranges from youth sports, to the pros, and beyond. Mark has a diversified portfolio across various multimedia , coaching and training platforms. Whether it’s hosting a sports show, covering the NBA draft in the Orlando Magic’s “war room”, or teaching young athletes the fundamentals of the game, Mark can do it all.
                    
                    <br><br>When he’s not working in the field, he enjoys giving back to the community by serving as a teacher and mentor to elementary, middle, and high schoolers throughout the Central Florida area.

                    <br><br>Since childhood he's been extremely passionate about the world of sports and its greater impact on society. Sports run in his family, with multiple relatives having played youth, collegiate, and pro sports (cousin of NFL Hall Of Famer and Tampa Bay Bucs legend Warren Sapp). 
                    
                    <br><br>The "basketball bug" bit Mark at an early age, as he began training in the back yard with neighbor friends and relatives, which led to Junior Magic, then AAU with Team Sosa, and Middle School basketball at Apopka Memorial Middle School where he played for Coach Kreger and Coach Montgomery throughout his middle school career. Growing up in Apopka Florida in the 90s and 2000s some of his favorite players were Penny Hardaway, the late great Kobe Bryant, Allen Iverson, Tracy McGrady, Steph Curry, Kevin Garnett, and the GOAT Michael Jordan.
                    
                    <br><br>Upon entering high school Mark made the basketball team at Apopka High School during his freshman year. During his 4 years at AHS as a Blue Darter basketball player, he played under Coach Eddie Jenkins, Coach Matt Houvourous, Coach Brian Pitts and Coach Ed Coffee. Unfortunately, injuries began to mount as he sustained arm and knee surgeries during his freshmen, and senior seasons (fractured forearm and shattered knee cap).
                    
                    <br><br>After graduation Mark intended to attend FSU, but sustained yet another knee injury which redirected him from the Seminoles to the FAMU Rattlers instead. While at FAMU Mark majored in Broadcast Journalism and interned at ESPN Headquarters in Bristol, Connecticut. As the injuries took their toll on his body, ending his competitive playing days, he redirected his focus into the world of Sports Broadcasting. After graduating from FAMU, he attended graduate school and the University of South Florida (USF) where he majored in Mass Communications.
                    
                    <br><br>He has worked at ESPN, the ESPN Wide World of Sports, with the Orlando Magic, at Channel 9 Eyewitness News, with FM 102.5, FAMU-TV20, 90.5 WANM, the “FAMUan” newspaper, and the USF athletic department. He's been an anchor, a reporter, a radio host, an editor, a producer, writer, and more. 
                    
                    <br><br>The "on the court itch" never left him, and he returned to the court in 2015, but this time instead of a player, he was a coach. He's coached at Apopka High, Windermere Prep, Apopka Middle, Wolf Lake Middle, and Teague Middle. In his 5 years as a head basketball coach he's taken 4 teams to championship games, he's won 2 titles, 1 district title and is just getting started!
                    
                    <br><br>He has an affable personality, and a knack for connecting with the public, audiences, and athletes of all levels… This ranges from youth sports, to the pros, and beyond. Mark has a diversified portfolio across various multimedia , coaching and training platforms. Whether it’s hosting a sports show, covering the NBA draft in the Orlando Magic’s “war room”, or teaching young athletes the fundamentals of the game, Mark can do it all.
                    
                    <br><br>When he’s not working in the field, he enjoys giving back to the community by serving as a teacher and mentor to elementary, middle, and high schoolers throughout the Central Florida area.
